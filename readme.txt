Senior Project.  Would move protiens if:
A) It was not closer than 2 units to any other protein
B) It was not further than sqrt(10) units of the adjacenet proteins
C) It could choose any adjacenet node given some probability determined by the electric field

Current bugs is innefficency of choosing a proper protein to move, as due to field constraints, will often keep chosing protien nodes it can't move.
